# Image_Compression_using_KMeans_clustering
The project highlights the effectiveness of K-means clustering as a method for image compression. By reducing the number of colors in an image, it showcases how data clustering techniques can be leveraged to significantly decrease file sizes while preserving visual representation to a reasonable extent.
